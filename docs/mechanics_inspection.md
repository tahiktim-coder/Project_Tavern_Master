# Mechanics: Inspection & Interrogation

This is the player's primary tool. You must play detective.

## 1. Visual "Tells" (The Passive Check)
Players must scan the character image for discrepancies.

| Visual Cue | Common Meaning | Possible Trap (The Twist) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shaking Hands** | `Cowardly` or `Withdrawal` (Drug/Drink) | Maybe they are just `Cold`? Check the weather. |
| **Expensive Jewelry** | `Wealthy` (Can accept lower pay) | They are a `Thief` (Stolen goods). |
| **Brand New Armor** | `Rookie` (Rich parents, no experience) | They are `Meticulous` (Takes good care of gear). |
| **Glowing Eyes** | `Magical` | possessed by `Demon`. |
| **Bandages** | `Injured` (Low HP start) | Hiding a specific `Curse` mark. |
| **Looking Away** | `Lying` / `Untrustworthy` | Just `Shy`. |

## 2. Dialogue & Interrogation (The Active Check)
You can ask 3 questions before they get annoyed and leave.

### Question Category: "Capabilities"
*   **"Can you handle a sword?"**
    *   *Confidence Check*: "I am the best!" (If `Arrogant`).
    *   *Hesitation*: "I... I think so." (If `Rookie`).
    *   *Specifics*: "I prefer axes." (Reveals `Weapon Preference`).

### Question Category: "History"
*   **"How did you get that scar?"**
    *   *Honest*: "Dragon bite." (Verifies `Veteran`).
    *   *Lie*: "Fell down stairs." (Hiding a shameful `Defeat`).

### Question Category: "The Test"
*   **"This quest requires swimming."**
    *   *Reaction*: If they are wearing Plate Armor, do they hesitate?
    *   *Yes*: They know the risk (High `WIS`).
    *   *No*: "I'll be fine!" -> They are `Stupid` and will drown.

## 3. The "Sheet" vs Reality
The document they hand you is their **Resume**. It is what they *want* you to think.
*   **Resume**: "Level 10 Paladin."
*   **Reality**: *Smells of alcohol, Holy Symbol is upside down.*
*   **Conclusion**: **IMPOSTOR**. Reject immediately.
