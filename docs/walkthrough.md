# Initial Setup Walkthrough

I have successfully initialized the project structure and generated the first visual asset.

## 1. File Structure
*   `index.html`: The main entry point, housing the game canvas.
*   `style.css`: Configured for **Pixel Art** rendering (`image-rendering: pixelated`) and uses the "Press Start 2P" retro font.
*   `script.js`: Set up with the main game loop and a placeholder "Waiting for adventurers..." screen.

## 2. Visual Assets
I regenerated the Main Menu background to match your feedback. It now features a bustling crowd of diverse adventurer portraits lining the edges, symbolizing the many heroes who will pass by your counter.

## 3. Next Steps
*   Integrate this image into the actual game loop as the "Start Screen".
*   Begin implementing the "Counter View" for the core gameplay.
