# Prioritized Feature Roadmap

## 1. The Living World & Narrative Loop
### A. The Weekly Crown Messenger (Core Loop)
*   **Cycle**: Arrives every 7 Days (Day 7, 14, 21...).
*   **Mechanic**:
    *   **Day 7**: Messenger gives a "Crown Quest" (Special visual frame, High difficulty).
    *   **Day 14**: Messenger returns.
        *   **Check**: Did you complete the previous Crown Quest?
        *   **Reward/Punish**: Gold/Reputation boost OR Reputation penalty/"Fines".
        *   **New Quest**: Issues the next Crown Quest.
*   **Narrative**: Allows for a continuous story thread distinct from daily random quests.

### B. Daily Random Encounters
*   **Timing**: Triggers at the start of the day (before first adventurer).
*   **Types**:
    *   **Merchant**: Sell items/consumables (Potions, etc.).
    *   **Mourning Widow**: Narrative consequence for adventurer deaths.
    *   **Bards/Rumors**: Grants a "Bonus Quest" (Hidden location).
        *   *Visual*: Bonus quests have a distinct look (e.g., Blue Wax Seal) on the board.

### C. Crown Reputation System
*   **UI**: A meter/icon on the left side of the screen.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **High Rep**: Better rewards, tax breaks.
    *   **Low Rep**: "Fucked up quests" (Suicide missions forced on you), higher taxes, inspections.

## 2. Adventurer & Guild Progression
### A. "Backend" Leveling (Organic Growth)
*   **Concept**: Adventurers are autonomous people. They grow on their own.
*   **Mechanic**: When they survive/complete quests, they gain XP/Levels invisibly.
*   **Stat Growth**:
    *   **Randomized**: Stats increase randomly upon leveling.
    *   **Class Weighed, Not Fixed**: A Ranger *usually* gains DEX, but might randomly gain STR or INT instead, creating unique builds (e.g., an Agile Barbarian vs. a Strong Barbarian).
*   **Visuals**: No "Level up!" popups. You see their stats change over time via Inspection.

### B. Items & Storage (To Be Implemented)
*   Simple inventory system to store bought/looted items.
*   Ability to "Gift" (Equip) items to adventurers.

## 3. Guild Upgrades (Spending Gold)
*   **Location**: Validated via Ledger/Journal.
*   **Types**:
    *   **Library (Scout Network)**: Upgrading reveals improved Inspection data (more accurate numbers, hidden traits).
    *   **Decor**: Improves "Tavern Appeal". Attracts higher-tier adventurers (Knights/Wizards) more frequently.
    *   *Note*: Roster Cap upgrades are **EXCLUDED** (Roster size is dictated by Story/Town growth).

---

## 4. Omitted Features (For Now)
*   **Party System**: Quests remain 1-Adventurer focused.
*   **Manual Stat Allocation**: The Guild Master manages the *business*, not the hero's build.
