# deep Market Analysis & Critical Review: Guild Master

## 1. Genre Positioning
"Guild Master" sits at the intersection of **Bureaucracy Simulation** (*Papers, Please*), **Management Sim** (*Recettear, Potionomics*), and **Dark Fantasy RPG** (*Darkest Dungeon*).

It effectively gamifies the "Quest Giver" role, which is a compelling hook. Instead of *doing* the quest, you *judge* who is fit to die for it.

## 2. Comparative Analysis (The Giants)

### **A. Papers, Please (PC/Mobile)**
*   **The Loop**: Inspect Documents -> Spot Discrepancies -> Approve/Deny.
*   **Why it Works**: The **Tension**. You are squeezed between *Time* (limited processing window), *Money* (family starving), and *Morality* (saving refugees vs. following rules).
*   **Critique of Guild Master**: Currently, we lack **Time Pressure** and **Moral Dilemmas**.
    *   *Issue*: You can inspect endlessly without cost.
    *   *Fix*: Inspection should cost Time or Action Points. Or the queue grows impatient. Or the King demands quotas.

### **B. Darkest Dungeon (PC/Console)**
*   **The Loop**: Prepare Party -> Dungeon Crawl (Stress/Combat) -> Town Management (Heal/Upgrade).
*   **Why it Works**: **Consequence**. Heroes are resources, but they have personality. Losing a Level 5 hero hurts emotionally and economically. The "Quirks" system makes every character unique.
*   **Critique of Guild Master**: Our heroes are currently disposable stat-blocks.
    *   *Issue*: If "Garrett the Fighter" dies, we just hire another.
    *   *Fix*: Implement "Veterancy". A hero who survives 3 quests should gain unique traits ("Dragon Slayer"). Losing them should feel like a major setback.

### **C. Soda Dungeon / Merchant Heroes (Mobile)**
*   **The Loop**: Hire -> Auto-Battle -> Loot -> Upgrade Tavern -> Hire Better.
*   **Why it Works**: **Progression Spiral**. Every run fuels the next. Numbers go up. Very addictive, bite-sized sessions.
*   **Critique of Guild Master**: Our economy is flat. Gold pays upkeep, but doesn't *unlock* power.
    *   *Issue*: 1000 Gold feels the same as 100 Gold.
    *   *Fix*: Visual progression. The Guild Hall should visually change from a shack to a fortress.

### **D. Yes, Your Grace (PC)**
*   **The Loop**: Listen to Petitioners -> Allocate Resources -> Story Consequences.
*   **Why it Works**: **Narrative Weight**. Deciding to give gold to a peasant might mean not affording an army later.
*   **Critique of Guild Master**: Our "Random Events" are good but currently disconnected.
    *   *Issue*: Events are just +/- Gold.
    *   *Fix*: Events should chain. Inspecting a "Spy" and hiring them should unlock "Espionage" quests later.

## 3. Platform Suitability Analysis

### **Mobile (iOS / Android)**
*   **Verdict**: **Extremely High Potential**.
*   **Reasoning**:
    *   **Controls**: The "Inspect -> Drag/Drop" loop is native to touch screens.
    *   **Session Length**: The Daily Cycle (Recruit -> Assign -> Report) takes ~2-3 minutes. Perfect for "bus stop gaming".
    *   **Monetization (Hypothetical)**: Fits the "Watch Ad to Reroll Tavern" or "Buy Guild Skins" model perfectly (though Premium is better).
*   **Risk**: Mobile markets are crowded. Visual polish needs to be "Juicy" (animations, sounds) to stand out.

### **PC (Steam / Itch.io)**
*   **Verdict**: **Moderate Potential (Needs Depth)**.
*   **Reasoning**:
    *   PC players demand **Systemic Depth**. They want to min-max stats, build synergies between party members, and unravel a story.
    *   Current state is too simple for a $10-$20 Steam game. It appeals more as a cozy/narrative simulation ($5 range).
    *   To succeed here, you need **Narrative Interaction**. The "Scanner" needs to reveal *Lore*, not just stats.

## 4. Honest Critique & "The Missing Link"

**The Vibe Check:**
The game currently feels like a *prototype*. It has the mechanics, but lacks the *soul*.

**1. The "Scanner" is Underutilized:**
*   Right now, it tells you stats. It should tell you **Secrets**.
*   *Idea*: A hero looks stronger than their stats. Scan reveals "Possessed by Demon". Do you hire them for the power, risking the Guild's safety?

**2. Where is the "Guild"?**
*   It's a solo experience. But a Guild is about *people*.
*   *Idea*: **Party Synergies**. Hiring a "Dwarf" and an "Elf" should cause friction (lower success chance) unless you have a "Peacekeeper" leader. This adds a puzzle element to roster management.

**3. The Economy is a Safety Net, not a Threat:**
*   You rarely feel threatened by bankruptcy.
*   *Idea*: **The King's Tax**. Every 7 days, the Tax doubles. You *must* take dangerous, high-reward quests to survive. This adds the "Push your luck" element.

**4. Visual Feedback:**
*   Reporting is text-based.
*   *Idea*: Show, don't just tell. Show the hero returning bloodied. Show the loot pile.

## 5. Strategic Recommendation

**Pivot to Narrative-Management (PC/Steam):**
Focus heavily on the **Papers, Please** aspect. Make the *act of judging* the recruit the core gameplay.
*   Make recruits lie.
*   Make quests have hidden requirements.
*   Make the "Scanner" your primary weapon against deception.

**OR**

**Pivot to Tycoon-Idle (Mobile):**
Focus heavily on **Progression**.
*   Automate recruitment later on.
*   Focus on building the Guild Hall physically.
*   Add prestige layers (New Game+).

**My Professional Advice:**
The "Narrative-Management" route aligns better with your current "Dark Fantasy" aesthetic and is less saturated than the Tycoon market. It allows for a cult classic potential.
